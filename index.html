          <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text">
            Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused
            by differences in the brain. Some people with ASD have a known
            difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet
            known. Scientists believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act
            together to change the most common ways people develop. We still
            have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people
            with ASD.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 text">
            People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways
            that are different from most other people. There is often nothing
            about how they look that sets them apart from other people. The
            abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly. For example,
            some people with ASD may have advanced conversation skills whereas
            others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in
            their daily lives;

        <p class="text-justify fs-5">
          Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be a challenging task,
          often requiring specialized training and expertise.The current
          diagnostic process can be time-consuming and costly. In response to
          this challenge, leveraging technology such as machine learning
          presents an opportunity to streamline the diagnosis process and
          improve accessibility to early intervention services.
        </p>
        <h3>The Complexity of Diagnosing Autism:</h3>
        <p class="text-justify fs-5">
          Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
          difficulties in social communication and interaction, as well as
          repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Diagnosing autism
          involves comprehensive assessments of a person's developmental
          history, behavior, and social communication skills. However, the
          variability in symptoms and the overlap with other developmental
          disorders can make diagnosis challenging, leading to delays in
          accessing appropriate interventions.
        </p>
        <h3>The Role of Machine Learning in Autism Detection:</h3>
        <p class="text-justify fs-5">
          Machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown promise in aiding the
          diagnosis of autism by analyzing patterns in behavioral data. By
          training ML models on large datasets of clinical information and
          behavioral observations, it becomes possible to identify patterns and
          features that are indicative of autism. These models can then be used
          to assist clinicians in making more accurate and timely diagnoses.

              Diagnosing autism is complex, requiring specialized evaluation.
              Early intervention is crucial, but the diagnostic process can be
              lengthy and challenging.
            </p>
            <h3>ML.NET's Role:</h3>
            <p class="fs-5 text">
              ML.NET, Microsoft's framework, enables .NET developers to
              integrate machine learning. Offers intuitive APIs and supports
              various tasks like classification and regression.
            </p>
            <h3>Developing the Model:</h3>
            <p class="fs-5 text">
              Gather a dataset with clinical and behavioral data from autistic
              and neurotypical individuals. Preprocess data (scaling,
              normalization) and train using appropriate ML algorithm. Evaluate
              model performance iteratively for refinement.
            </p>
            <h3> Building the Windows App:</h3>
            <p class="fs-5 text">
              Utilize .NET tools like windows form to create a user-friendly
              interface. Users input data, and the app predicts autism
              likelihood using the trained model.
            </p>
            <h3> Benefits:</h3>
